# pinto

A super minimal build and dev tool for little HTML projects, for when you have a simple single page and you want a bit of javascript and css.

## what it does

Pinto creates a completely static html page from the following:

* an HTML file
* a single CSS file
* a single JS file
* a template data file

And exposes the template data and the transformed css and js to the html file via mustache.

## why not webpack

Sometimes I want something less intense, and for really small things I can get away with something small and fast.
