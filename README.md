# pinto

Sometimes all I want to build is a simple static HTML page with a bit of JavaScript and CSS, but I still want to use a bit of templating, and I still want to minify everything and take advantage of fancy javascript and scss. So I made this tool.

## what it does

pinto combines a single HTML file (mustache template), a single JS file, and a single CSS file into a completely static page.
